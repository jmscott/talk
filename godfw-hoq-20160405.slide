* Paul Graham - YCombinator
 Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of.
 It works, but you don't know why.

* What is a Compiler?
- program that transforms a formal language into another formal language
- immutable - same input language always yields same output language
- output language - called the _target_ - executes "fastest"
Does a compilier define semantics of either source or target language?

* Examples of Typically Compiled Languages
- go
- c
- java
- perl5 is *NOT* compiled
- *perl6* will eventually be compiled
- YACC compiles Backus-Naur into Go (and many other languages)
- Ken Thompson (gofather) compilied regular expressions into `pdp11` assembler
- compiling SQL into native code (Oracle, PostgreSQL)

* What is an Interpreter?
- program that directly executes the source program (often text)

- bourne shell, awk, javascript, ruby, SQL
- lisp was the first interpreter
- the java command is an interpreter of compiled java class files

* Interpreter Translates Source into Internal Format
.image godfw-hoq-20160405/ast.png
.caption Abstract Syntax Tree (perl5, awk)
- line by line (many unix shells)
- virtual machine instruction (python, ruby, vbasic, java, perl6)
- just in time compilation (java)

* Abstract Syntax Tree of a Query Fragment in HOQ
.image godfw-hoq-20160405/ast.png
.caption Query Fragment
  $1 == "INBOUND" and ( $2 ~~ "^10[.]" or $2 ~~ "^192[.]168" )

* What is HOQ?
- toy interpreter that demonstrates the famous YACC compiler for Go language
- also, hopefully, demonstrates "Communicating Sequential Processes"

Did I bite off more than I can chew?

* Inspired by HOC Calculator in "Unix Programming Environment"

* How Do We Invoke HOQ?
- command line program invoked like
 hoq file.hoq <data.in
- hoq script itself _may_ invoke other unix programs and wait for their exit status
- output of `stdout` and `stderr` are not captured

* HOQ Execution is Driven by Standard Input
- consuming text drives the execution of the whole hoq script
 tr ',' '\t' quarterly.csv | hoq quarterly.hoq
.caption Terminal
- hoq terminates after reading the the final line and waiting for all processes to exit.

* HOQ Splits Input Into Fields
- input lines `strings.Split()` on tab separated boundaries
 line = strings.TrimRight(line, "\n")
 ...
 fields:   strings.SplitN(line, "\t", 255),
- `$1` is first tab separated field, `$2` is second, ...
- `$0` is whole, current line, including tabs, minus terminating new line

* HOQ is Mostly Declarative
- freeform syntax with _#_ comments and flowing whitespace
- execution order determined by boolean qualifications
- qualify on patterns in `$` fields
- qualify on process exit status codes (`uint8`)
- concurrent execution of processes determined by flow of data up a query tree

* Hello, World

.code godfw-hoq-20160405/say.hoq 
.caption say.hoq

* Invoke Say
.code godfw-hoq-20160405/say.hoq 
.caption say.hoq

.code godfw-hoq-20160405/say.term 
.caption Terminal

* Good Bye, Cruel World
.code godfw-hoq-20160405/say-bye.hoq 
.caption say-bye.hoq

.code godfw-hoq-20160405/say-bye.term 
.caption Terminal

* Trinity

* Is Wu Wei Nothing?

* Abstract Syntax Tree is a Flow Graph
.image godfw-hoq-20160405/ast.png
 $1 == "INBOUND" and ( $2 ~~ "^10[.]" or $2 ~~ "^192[.]168[.]" )

* Data Flows From Leaves (OpCodes) to Root
.image godfw-hoq-20160405/ast-flow.png
.caption _$1_ == "INBOUND" and ( _$2_ ~~ "^10[.]" or _$2_ ~~ "^192[.]168[.]" )
Node is GoRoutine that Waits for Inbound Data, Crunchs, Then Writes Answer to Parent

* Opcode Code: const_string()
.code godfw-hoq-20160405/opcode-const-string.go
.caption 'Push' a String Constant

* Go Idiom #1
#.code godfw-hoq-20160405/idiom-1.go
.code t.go

* Go Idioms in HOQ
- `close(channel)` is cheap broadcast
- easy to transform sequential functions into concurrent functions
- null method pointer allows easy termination of recusion
- streaming 1-many/many-1 mappings via fanin/fanout operators (map reduce?)
- `select{}` on channels is not your parent's `synchronized{}`

* What is Go YACC?
- Compiles a Flavor of Backus-Naur Form (BNF) into Go Code
- Orginal Golang Grammar written in YACC
- Domain Specific Languages (chemical reactions, SAT solvers)
- Mutation Coverage

* Backus-Naur Grammar of Backus-Naur
 Production  = name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
 Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
 Alternative = Term { Term } .
 Term        = name | token [ "â€¦" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
 Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
 Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
 Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .

* HOQ Backus-Naur, Go Code Stripped
.code godfw-hoq-20160405/hoq.bnf

* YACC Needs a Lexer 
- busts text into stream of integer tokens
- token has a value related to scan
- lexer can be a big switch{}
- lexer easy to write by hand
- token constants defined by YACC (see %token in grammar)
- co-routines invented to write lexers

* HOQ Grammar and Go Code

* Go Files
- hoq.go
- ast.go
- command.go (rename to exec.go)?
- compile.go
- opcode.go
- parser.y
- rummy.go
- tsort.go

* Opcodes and Machine Model
- const_string, const_bool, const_uint8
- to_string_uint8, to_string_bool
- dollar, dollar0
- string_rel2, uint8_rel2, bool_rel2
- argv0, argv1, argv
- exec
- fanout_uint8, fanin_uint8
